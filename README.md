## LTI Dev Blog Wordpress Theme

Wordpress Theme used on the [LTI Dev blog](http://dev.linguisticteam.org)

This theme is not meant to be distributed because it doesn't handle translation domains properly and uses certain features a little hastily.

There's very little in the way of functionality that would be a boon to the community, so we're keeping it under the vest for now.

That being said, here's a quick list of features we tried to implement:
- Table of contents for posts, generates a quick unordered list based on header tags placed in articles, allowing the user to navigate through it
- Extra profile fields for developers who want to feature their dev related accounts in their user profile
- Sharing buttons, loaded as a widget or directly on the page

Feel free to discuss, share or distribute the content, and as usual, issue submissions, forks & pull requests are more than welcome.
